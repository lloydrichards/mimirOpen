/*
  This example code will walk you through how to enable power save mode on your
  Ambient Light Sensor. When would you use power save mode? The datasheet
  specifies that power save mode is perfect when you want to continuously
  sample ambient light readings from your sensor, as opposed to getting a
  reading once an hour for example. The benefit of power save mode is lower
  power consumption, with current draw in the single digit micro-amp range. 
  Enabling the power save mode decreases the refresh rate of the sensor and so
  sampling should happen at a slower rate. Last thing, the refresh rate is also
  dependent on the integration time setting of the sensor. See the hookup guide 
  for a table showing the correlation of refresh times, current consumption, power 
  mode, and integration mode settings.
